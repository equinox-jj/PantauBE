# Pantau

Pantau is a Spring Boot backend for citizen incident reporting. Citizens submit reports (with photo evidence and
geolocation) about issues in their area, and resolvers track and update the status of those reports through their
lifecycle.

## Tech Stack

- **Java 21** / **Spring Boot 4.1**
- **Spring Data JPA** + **PostgreSQL** (with **PostGIS** via `hibernate-spatial` for geospatial queries)
- **Flyway** for database migrations
- **Spring Security** with **JWT** authentication (`jjwt`)
- **MapStruct** + **Lombok**
- **Cloudinary** for image/file storage
- **Maven** build

Database migrations live in `src/main/resources/db/migration`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 21
- PostgreSQL with the PostGIS extension enabled
- A Cloudinary account (for photo uploads)

### Configuration

Copy `.env` and fill in the required values:

```
# Application
APP_ENV=
APP_PORT=

# Database
DB_HOST=
DB_PORT=
DB_NAME=
DB_USER=
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_MAX_OPEN_CONNS=
DB_MAX_IDLE_CONNS=

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=

# JWT
JWT_SECRET_KEY=       # e.g. openssl rand -base64 64
JWT_EXPIRATION=       # milliseconds

# Cloudinary
CLOUDINARY_NAME=
CLOUDINARY_KEY=
CLOUDINARY_SECRET=
```

Flyway runs automatically on startup and applies migrations against `DB_NAME`.

### Run

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

### Test

```bash
./mvnw test
```

## API Overview

All responses are wrapped in a common `ApiResponse<T>` envelope (`success`, `message`, `data`) and JSON fields use
snake_case.

### Auth — `/api/v1/auth`

| Method | Endpoint    | Description               |
|--------|-------------|---------------------------|
| POST   | `/register` | Register a new user       |
| POST   | `/login`    | Authenticate, returns JWT |

### Reports — `/api/v1/reports`

| Method | Endpoint        | Access     | Description                                            |
|--------|-----------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| POST   | `/`             | `CITIZEN`  | Create a report (multipart, with photo)                |
| GET    | `/{id}`         | Public     | Get report detail                                      |
| GET    | `/{id}/history` | Public     | Get a report's status change history                   |
| GET    | `/nearby`       | Public     | List reports near a latitude/longitude within a radius |
| GET    | `/mine`         | `CITIZEN`  | List the authenticated user's reports                  |
| PATCH  | `/{id}`         | `CITIZEN`  | Update a report (multipart, owner only)                |
| DELETE | `/{id}`         | `CITIZEN`  | Delete a report (owner only)                           |
| GET    | `/queue`        | `RESOLVER` | List queued reports by tab, sorted by distance         |
| PATCH  | `/{id}/status`  | `RESOLVER` | Update a report's status                               |

Report status follows: `REPORTED → ACKNOWLEDGED → IN_PROGRESS → RESOLVED → CLOSED`, with `REJECTED` as a terminal
alternate state. Allowed transitions are enforced in `ReportStatusTransitions`.

The resolver queue (`/queue`) groups reports into tabs: `OPEN` (`REPORTED`, `ACKNOWLEDGED`), `IN_PROGRESS`, and
`RESOLVED`.

### Categories — `/api/v1/categories`

| Method | Endpoint       | Description          |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|
| GET    | `/`            | List all categories  |
| GET    | `/{id}`        | Get category by ID   |
| GET    | `/slug/{slug}` | Get category by slug |

### Users — `/api/v1/users`

| Method | Endpoint | Access | Description                          |
|--------|----------|--------|--------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/me`    | Auth   | Get the authenticated user's profile |

## Roles

- **CITIZEN** — creates, updates, and deletes own reports
- **RESOLVER** — works the queue, updates report status
